Practical No: 7
Problem Specification: Using the arithmetic operators(+,-,/,*,%)
Implementation: 
         class Ex07{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		double a=5.0;
		double b=2.0;
	  
	  System.out.println("Addition is "+(a+b));
	  System.out.println("Substraction is "+(a-b));
	  System.out.println("Multiplication is "+(a*b));
	  System.out.println("Division is "+(a/b));
	  System.out.println("Mode value is "+(a%b));
	  
	}
}
Output: 
       Addition is 7.0
       Substraction is 3.0
       Multiplication is 10.0
       Division is 2.5
       Mode value is 1.0
Conclusion: Learned to use the arithmetic operators.
